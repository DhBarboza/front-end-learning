                <p>
                    The band Starset was formed in 2013 in Columbus, Ohio, by
                    vocalist and songwriter

                    engineering, fused his passions for science and music to
                    create a unique artistic proposition.

                <p>
                    The concept behind Starset goes beyond music, involving a
                    fictional and futuristic narrative. The band crafted a story
                    about an organization called
                    <span class="bold"> "The Starset Society,"</span> aiming to
                    disseminate knowledge about science and explore the
                    mysteries of the universe. This narrative inspired both the
                    band's visual aesthetic and the lyrics of their songs.
                </p>
                <p>
